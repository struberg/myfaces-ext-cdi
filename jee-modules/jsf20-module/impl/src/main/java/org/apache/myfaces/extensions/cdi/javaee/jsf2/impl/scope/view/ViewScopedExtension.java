/**
 * <p>This CDI extension enables support for the new JSF-2 &#064;ViewScoped annotation.</p>
 *
 * <p>2 steps are necessary:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>We have to manually add the &#064;ViewScoped annotation
 * as a passivating {@link javax.enterprise.context.NormalScope},
 * since this annotation is neither a JSR-330 annotation
 * nor a JSR-299 annotation and therefor doesn't get picked up automatically. This has to be
 * before the bean scanning starts.</li>
 * <li>After the bean scanning succeeded, we register the
 *  {@link javax.enterprise.context.spi.Context} for the
 * ViewScoped. The {@link ViewScopedContext} is responsible for actually storing all our
 * &#064;ViewScoped contextual instances in the JSF ViewMap.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The extension automatically detects if we are in the
 * {@link ProjectStage#UnitTest} and uses
 * </p>
